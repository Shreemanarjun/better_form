## 0.1.1

### ✨ New Features
- **Enhanced Type Safety for Sealed Classes**:
  - Improved `FormixFieldID<T>` and `FormixBatch` to correctly handle inheritance. Values that are subclasses of `T` (such as sealed class implementations) are now properly allowed in `setValue`, `setValues`, and `applyBatch`.
  - Added `isTypeValid` and `isNullableType` to `FormixFieldID` for robust runtime type checking.
  - Added `sameTypes<S, V>()` utility for exact type comparison when mutual sub-typing is required.
- **Async Field Enhancements**:
  - Implemented `onData` callback for `FormixAsyncField` and `FormixDependentAsyncField` to enable safe post-load side effects and initial value selection.
  - Simplified async field initial selection by favoring the `onData` callback over manual logic in builders.
- **Robust Form Reset**:
  - Added `clearErrors` parameter to `reset`, `resetToValues`, and `resetFields` methods to prevent immediate validation errors after a reset.
  - Enhanced reset logic to automatically cancel pending async validations and remove errors from the internal validation map.
  - Reset operations now correctly trigger re-validation for dependent fields of reset fields.
- **Granular Reactivity**:
  - Added selector support to `FormixDependentField` and `FormixFieldDerivation` for optimized updates.
  - Exposed `onData` for better integration in parent-child field relationships.
- **Type-Safe Field Preservation**:
  - Safely preserve and reuse existing field validators and transformers during re-registration (e.g., during hot reload or wizard step navigation) by introducing wrapped versions for automatic type conversion.

### 🛠️ Core Improvements
- **Consistent Batch Updates**:
  - `RiverpodFormController` now leverages `FormixFieldID` type information during batch updates even when fields are not yet registered.
  - Enhanced type validation logic to ensure consistency between provided `FormixFieldID`s and existing initial values in the form state.
  - Improved error messages for type mismatches, now providing better context when values are incompatible with previously inferred types.

### ⚡ Performance Optimizations
- **Aggressive Caching**:
  - Implemented `InputDecoration` and `TextInputFormatter` list caching in `FormixTextFormField` and `FormixNumberFormField` to avoid redundant theme resolution.
  - Added explicit `FormixParameter` and provider caching in `FormixState` to avoid redundant family lookups and hash calculations during rebuilds.
  - Added `PERFORMANCE.md` documenting the library's internal optimization strategies.
- **Stable Provider Lifecycle**:
  - Switched from `ref.watch` to `ref.listen` for localized messages in `formControllerProvider`. This prevents form state resets during language/locale changes.
  - Updated `FormixParameter` to use `DeepCollectionEquality` for all collection fields, ensuring provider stability when parameters are recreated with identical data.
- **Optimized Rebuilds**:
  - Refined `_FieldRegistrar` to skip redundant registrations using `ListEquality`.
  - Optimized `SliverFormixArray` to watch the provider's notifier, preventing unnecessary list rebuilds on unrelated field changes.
- **Other Improvements**:
  - Added `updateMessages()` to `RiverpodFormController` for reactive message updates without controller recreation.

### 🧪 Testing
- **Sealed Class Type Safety**: Added `test/sealed_class_test.dart` to verify correct handling of sealed classes and subclasses in batch updates and field state.
- Added comprehensive widget tests for `SliverFormixArray` and `FormixAsyncField`'s `onData` behavior.
- Added stability test suite for verifying controller preservation across parent rebuilds and message updates.
- Total test count: 654 tests passing.

## 0.1.0

### ✨ New Features
- **Configurable Initial Value Strategy**:
  - Introduced `FormixInitialValueStrategy` enum to control how fields adopt initial values after their first registration.
  - Added `preferLocal` strategy (default): Fields intelligently adopt values from widgets if the current state is `null` and not yet modified by the user. This solves common issues with late-initialized data in dynamic forms or wizards.
  - Added `preferGlobal` strategy: Fields strictly adhere to the initial value provided during the very first registration (at the `Formix` root), ignoring subsequent updates from nested widgets.
  - Strategy can be configured at the `FormixFieldConfig` level or overridden on individual field widgets.

### 🛠️ Core Improvements & Fixes
- **Type Safety Fix for Field Registration**:
  - Fixed critical type casting error in `FormixFieldWidgetState._ensureFieldRegistered` that occurred when preserving validators from existing fields.
  - Now uses `wrappedValidator`, `wrappedAsyncValidator`, `wrappedCrossFieldValidator`, and `wrappedTransformer` methods to safely handle type conversions between `dynamic` and typed validators.
  - Resolves runtime errors like `type '(DateTime?) => String?' is not a subtype of type '((dynamic) => String?)?'` when using typed fields with custom validators.
  - Added comprehensive test suite (`type_safety_field_registration_test.dart`) covering DateTime, TimeOfDay, complex objects, and validator override scenarios.

- **Unified Ancestor Validation**:
  - Introduced `FormixAncestorValidator` to centralize `ProviderScope` and `Formix` requirement checks across all widgets.
  - Improved developer experience with rich, descriptive error messages and actionable code examples when configuration is missing.
- **Robust Field Re-registration**: Updated `registerFields` logic to track newly registered fields versus definition updates, ensuring state preservation while correctly applying initial values when appropriate.
- **FormixSection Fix**: Implemented `didUpdateWidget` in `FormixSection` to reliably catch and register configuration changes, fixing a bug where fields in dynamic wizards or reused sections occasionally failed to initialize.
- **Unified Widget API**: Exposed `initialValueStrategy` on all standard and adaptive form fields for fine-grained control.
- **Flexibility Enhancements**: Updated `FormixDependentField` and `FormixDependentAsyncField` to support standalone usage outside of `Formix` widgets by falling back to the global controller provider.
- **Robust Reset with clearErrors**:
  - Enhanced `reset`, `resetToValues`, and `resetFields` to reliably clear all error states when `clearErrors: true` is provided.
  - Automatically cancels all pending asynchronous validation debouncers during reset to prevent late-arriving errors.
  - Correctly triggers re-validation for dependent fields of reset fields, ensuring consistent form-wide validity state.
  - Resets the validation lifecycle by removing internal validation flags, preventing premature re-validation in "onUserInteraction" mode.
- **Fixed Hidden Bug**: Resolved an edge-case where `initialValue` provided in a widget was ignored if the field had been pre-registered in the root `Formix` widget with a `null` value.
- **Golden Test Refresh**: Updated all error state golden tests to reflect the new premium error UI.

### ⚡ Performance Optimizations
- **Cached InputDecoration** (FormixTextFormField & FormixNumberFormField):
  - Implemented intelligent caching of `InputDecoration` to avoid redundant theme resolution.
  - Decoration is only rebuilt when widget properties or theme actually changes.
  - Reduces `Theme.of(context)` lookups and decoration processing overhead.
  - **New**: Added caching for final effective decoration (with error/helper text).
  - **New**: Added caching for input formatters list.
- **Combined Field State Notifier**:
  - Consolidated 4 separate `ValueNotifier`s (value, validation, dirty, touched) into a single combined notifier.
  - Reduces `AnimatedBuilder` overhead from 4 listenables to 1.
  - Significantly improves rebuild performance for rapid state changes.
- **Optimized Controller Subscription Setup**:
  - Added early return optimization for explicit controllers in `FormixFieldWidgetState`.
  - Avoids unnecessary Riverpod subscription setup when controller is provided directly.
  - Cleaner, more efficient code path for common use cases.
- **SliverFormixArray Optimization**:
  - Fixed rebuild issue: Changed `ref.watch(provider)` to `ref.watch(provider.notifier)`.
  - Now only rebuilds when controller instance changes, not on every form state change.
  - Prevents unnecessary rebuilds in large scrollable forms.
- **Performance Impact**:
  - **Formix vs Flutter Baseline**: 13-22% **FASTER** than plain Flutter TextFormField!
    - Passive Rebuild: 7.985ms (Flutter: 10.274ms) - **22% faster**
    - Mount/Unmount: 1.670ms (Flutter: 1.928ms) - **13% faster**
  - Pure Formix overhead: ~0.08ms per rebuild (negligible)
  - Mount/Unmount cycles: ~1.5ms per cycle
  - **Key Insight**: Granular selectors + aggressive caching = faster than baseline!
- **Enhanced Benchmarks**:
  - Consolidated all performance tests into `formix_benchmarks_test.dart`.
  - Added **baseline Flutter TextFormField benchmarks** for accurate comparison.
  - Each test runs 3 times with 1000 iterations and averages results for accuracy.
  - Beautiful box-drawing output format for easy performance tracking.
  - Comprehensive documentation in `BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md` and `REBUILD_OPTIMIZATION.md`.

### 🧪 Testing

  - 10 test cases covering rendering, CRUD operations, empty states, and rebuild optimization.
  - Verified that array items don't rebuild on unrelated field changes.
  - Integration tests with SliverAppBar, FormixGroup, and complex UI patterns.
- **Total Test Count**: 646 tests passing (10 new SliverFormixArray tests).



## 0.0.9

### 🛠️ Core Improvements & Fixes
- **Improved Lifecycle Management**:
  - `Formix` now robustly handles external controllers with `keepAlive: true`, ensuring they are not disposed even when the widget tree is rebuilt or navigation occurs.
  - Added `preventDisposal` flag to `RiverpodFormController` to support external lifecycle management.
  - Converted `FormixBuilder` to `ConsumerStatefulWidget` for reliable resource cleanup and correct interaction with Riverpod's referencing system.
- **Enhanced Debugging**:
  - Added meaningful `toString()` implementation to `FormixParameter` for easier debugging of provider families.
- **Initial Value Override**: Fixed logic to correctly prioritize field-level `initialValue` over global form default values. This ensures that explicitly configured fields (e.g., in `FormixTextFormField`) always retain their specific initial values.
- **Lazy Step State Preservation**: Fixed a critical issue where re-registering a field (such as waking a lazy step in a wizard) would overwrite user-entered data with the initial value. Now, `Formix` intelligently preserves "dirty" (user-modified) values while still applying initial values to "clean" fields.
- **Race Condition Fix**: Resolved a race condition in `registerFields` where rapid field registrations could lead to lost validation state updates. The state calculation is now encapsulated within the update closure for reliable sequential execution.

## 0.0.8

### ✨ New Features
- **Form-Level Theming**:
  - Introduced `FormixTheme` and `FormixThemeData` for centralized styling.

  - Added comprehensive `toMap()` and `fromMap()` methods to `FormixData` for complete state serialization including:
    - All field values (preserving types)
    - Validation states and error messages
    - Dirty, touched, and pending states
    - Form metadata (isSubmitting, resetCount, currentStep)
    - Calculated counts (errorCount, dirtyCount, pendingCount)
  - Added `toMap()` and `fromMap()` to `ValidationResult` for proper validation state persistence.
  - Added `initialData` parameter to `Formix` widget and `FormixController` for restoring form state on initialization.
  - Optimized `FormixParameter` identity to exclude `initialData`, preventing unnecessary provider recreation.
  - Full test coverage with unit tests and golden snapshot tests demonstrating restoration in real-world scenarios.
- **Improved Documentation**:
  - Added "Conditional Fields" guide to README explaining usage of `FormixSection` with `keepAlive: false` for dynamic forms.
  - Added comprehensive `ConditionalFormExample` in example app showing real-world dynamic field patterns.

### 🛠️ Core Improvements & Bug Fixes
- **Robust Count Tracking**:
  - Refactored internal validation logic in `_batchUpdate` and `validate` methods to ensure atomic updates of `errorCount` and `pendingCount`.
  - Fixed "Double Counting" bug where `errorCount` was decremented twice during transitions from "invalid" to "async validating".
  - Fixed "Leaked Pending Count" where transitions from "validating" to "invalid" (synchronously) failed to decrement `pendingCount`.

  - **Performance Metrics**: Reactive validation duration labels with color-coded status.
- **Integrated refreshing**: New auto-refresh logic with customizable intervals (1s-10s) and a dedicated sync indicator.
- **formDataProvider**: Added a reactive provider to expose the entire `FormixData` state.

### ✨ Accessibility & Semantics (shadcn-inspired)
- **Form Semantics**: The `Formix` widget now automatically reports as a `SemanticsRole.form`, improving structural navigation for screen readers.
- **Validation Semantics**: All fields (including headless ones) now communicate their validation status (`invalid`/`valid`) directly to the OS via `SemanticsValidationResult`.
- **Intelligent Announcements**: Added `FormixController.announceErrors()` which automatically reads out the first validation error to assistive technologies when a submission fails.

### 🚀 Standard Field Properties
- **Unified API**: All Formix fields (`Text`, `Number`, `Checkbox`, `Dropdown`) now support standard `FormField` properties:
  - `onSaved` & `onReset` hooks.
  - `enabled` state management.
  - `forceErrorText` for manual error overrides.
  - `errorBuilder` for custom error UI.
  - `autovalidateMode` for per-field validation control.
  - `restorationId` for state restoration.
- **Explicit Controller**: The `Formix` widget now supports an optional explicit `controller` parameter, allowing for manual instantiation while keeping the reactive provider benefits.

### 🛠️ Core Improvements & Fixes
- **Headless API**: `FormixFieldStateSnapshot` now exposes `enabled` and `errorBuilder`, making it easier to build high-quality custom components.
- **Validation Fix**: Fixed `RiverpodFormController.registerField` to strictly honor `autovalidateMode` during initial registration, preventing unwanted errors in `disabled` forms.
- **Type-Safe Value Retrieval**:
  - Reverted `getValue<T>` to return `T?` for better safety and backwards compatibility.
  - Added "smart fallback" to `getValue`: now recovers values from `initialValueMap` or field definitions if a field is not yet registered.
  - Introduced `requireValue<T>`: returns `T` and throws a descriptive `StateError` if the value is null.
- **New Field Transformers**:
  - `FormixFieldTransformer`: Synchronous 1-to-1 transformation between fields.
  - `FormixFieldAsyncTransformer`: Asynchronous transformation with built-in debounce and robust lifecycle management.
- **Hot Reload Support**: Fixed field definitions not updating during hot reload. `Formix` and `FormixSection` now reliably detect configuration changes and update the controller.
- **Riverpod Refactors**: Key widgets (`FormixFieldDerivation`, `FormixGroup`, `FormixListener`) upgraded to `ConsumerStatefulWidget` for better state access.
- **Hot Reload Support**: Fixed field definitions not updating during hot reload. `Formix` and `FormixSection` now reliably detect configuration changes and update the controller.
- **FormixSection Overhaul**: Refactored to `ConsumerStatefulWidget` for consistent lifecycle management.
  - Now supports synchronous registration to prevent lazy-loading race conditions.
  - Reliably handles `keepAlive` for preserving state in wizards and tabs.
- **Undo/Redo Stability**: Fixed history pollution where focus/touch events triggered unnecessary undo steps. History is now strictly value-based using deep equality checks.
- **Validation Fixes**:
  - `FormixAutovalidateMode.always` now correctly shows errors immediately upon registration for all field types.
  - Fixed input formatter ordering in `FormixTextFormField` and `FormixNumberFormField` to ensure config-level formatters (logic) run before widget-level formatters (UI).
- **New `FormixAsyncField`**: Added a dedicated widget for handling asynchronous data fetching within forms.
  - Features built-in race condition protection and retry logic.
  - Automatically re-triggers fetch on form reset (via `onRetry`).
  - Coordinated with the form's `isPending` state for submission safety.
- **New `FormixDependentAsyncField`**: A simplified widget for parent-child field relationships.
  - Automatically watches a dependency and executes a future.
  - **Improved Robustness**: Fixed lifecycle issues where fields could occasionally unregister during rapid state transitions.
  - Supports `resetField` to automatically clear dependent fields when the parent changes.
- **Robust Reset Logic**: Form resets are now tracked via an internal `resetCount`, ensuring the `onReset` hook is reliably triggered for all fields regardless of their previous dirty state.
- **Improved Pending State Management**: Fixed "Tried to modify a provider while the widget tree was building" error by moving pending state updates to microtasks.
- **Multi-Step Form Reliability**: Fixed a bug where navigating back to a previous page in a multi-step form would show "required" validation errors even if fields were filled. Formix now correctly validates against preserved values during re-registration.
- **Dropdown Field**: Migrated `FormixDropdownFormField` to use `InputDecorator` + `DropdownButton`. Now defensively handles values not present in the items list to prevent crashes during dynamic transitions.
- **Global Validation Mode**:
  - Introduced form-level `autovalidateMode` in `Formix` widget and `FormixController`.
  - Added `FormixAutovalidateMode.auto` as the default for all fields, allowing them to inherit the form's global setting or explicitly override it.
  - Improved `onUserInteraction` logic to ensure consistent feedback when values are changed and then reverted to their initial state.
- **Infinite Loop Fix**: Optimized `FormixController` listener notifications to prevent infinite loops when fields trigger state changes during updates (e.g., in `FormixFieldAsyncTransformer`).
- **Robust Bulk Update API**:
  - Added `FormixBatch` for compile-time type-safe batch building with a new fluent `setValue().to()` API for guaranteed lint enforcement.
  - Added `FormixBatchResult` for detailed reporting on batch failures (type mismatches, missing fields).
  - Both `setValues` and `updateFromMap` now return results instead of throwing, with an optional `strict: true` mode for developers who prefer immediate crashes during debugging.
- **High-Performance Dependency Tracking**:
  - Re-engineered `_collectTransitiveDependents` with a high-speed BFS implementation using an index-based queue, reducing traversal time for 100,000-field chains from **332ms to ~160ms**.
  - Optimized internal dependents map access with zero-allocation iterables.
- **Async Validation Stability**:
  - Fixed a critical race condition where `submit()` could hang indefinitely if called while an async validation was already pending.
  - Corrected `pendingCount` double-increment bug during concurrent validation cycles.
  - Consolidated "validating" state transitions into primary batch updates, eliminating redundant UI rebuilds.
- **Optimized State Engine**:
  - Implemented **Lazy Map Cloning** for validation results, avoiding O(N) penalties when field values change but validation results remain constant.
  - Shared `FormixData` validation contexts across batch updates to drastically reduce GC pressure in cross-field validation chains.
  - Replaced functional filter/map operations in hot paths with high-performance manual loops for count calculations.
- **Validation Fixes**:
  - Fixed `onUserInteraction` mode regression where valid results weren't properly cached to track the "previously validated" state.
  - Corrected `FormixAutovalidateMode.always` behavior during initial field registration.
- **DevTools Integration**: Forms without an explicit `formId` now automatically register with DevTools using their internal namespace as a fallback, ensuring full visibility.
